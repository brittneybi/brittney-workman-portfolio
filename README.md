      <h3>1. HR Workforce &amp; Compensation Analytics</h3>
         <p> 
       
    A focused Power BI report for analyzing workforce composition and compensation. 
    It answers practical questions such as:
        - How many active employees do we have today and how has headcount changed?
        - What is our compensation run‑rate, and how does it split across salary vs. hourly roles?
        - How do departments and locations compare on average/median compensation and headcount?            
        - What are the hire and exit patterns (timing and reasons) of our employees, and how do they affect current cost?

<h3>2. Timeclock &amp; Employee Payroll Report</h3>
 <p> 
       
    This report analyzes employee timeclock activity, worked hours, and payroll cost at both a summary and employee‑level granularity.
    It is designed to support HR, payroll processing teams, and operational managers who need reliable visibility into labor trends.
        - Daily, weekly, and pay‑period tracking
        - Regular vs Overtime calculations
        - Labor cost estimation using pay rates
        - Department-level rollups for operational insights
        - Dynamic date filters (Pay Period, Last 7 Days, Custom Range)
        - Drill into individual employee activity and detail pages
